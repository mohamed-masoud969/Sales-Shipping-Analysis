# üìä Sales-Shipping-Analysis

## üìå Overview
This technical report presents an analytical overview of 
Superstore sales data from 2015 to 2018. 
The objective is to explore sales trends, uncover customer 
behavior patterns, and identify business drivers affecting 
performance.  
The analysis focuses on discovering the most profitable 
regions, top-selling product categories, and underlying 
factors influencing sales such as shipping modes. 
The insights extracted will serve as a foundation for further 
business intelligence and strategic decision-making.
## üóÉÔ∏è Data
- Sales Data: Excel file with orders, products, and revenue information
- Cleaned and transformed using Power Query

## üéØ Objectives
- The primary objectives of this analysis are: 
1. To analyze sales trends between 2015 and 2018 across 
different time periods. 
2. To identify top-performing product categories and 
sub-categories. 
3. To evaluate customer purchasing behavior and segment 
performance. 
4. To determine high-performing regions and states based on 
revenue. 
5. To investigate key factors that influence sales performance 
(e.g., discounts, shipping, segment). 
6. To prepare the dataset for dashboarding and further business 
intelligence applications.

## Data Description 
The dataset was sourced from an Excel file and contains 
approximately 9,800 rows and 18 columns. It covers key aspects of 
the Superstore's operations from 2015 to 2018, including order 
information, sales figures, product details, customer data, and 
regional segmentation.  
Initially, the dataset was not clean and included missing values and 
formatting inconsistencies; These issues were resolved during the 
data cleaning process to ensure data accuracy and enable 
meaningful analysis. 
## Data Cleaning  
The dataset was initially imported into SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) 
for data preprocessing.  
During the initial review, we identified duplicate records across the 
dataset, which were removed to ensure data integrity. 
Next, we discovered inconsistencies in Product IDs , where 
identical or highly similar products had slightly different identifiers.  
These discrepancies were standardized using SSIS transformations to 
unify the product reference. 
We also encountered missing or incomplete data in several fields, 
particularly the Postal Code. 
To address this, we performed manual verification and used external 
sources to look up and fill in missing postal codes based on city and 
state information, ensuring data completeness and consistency. 
##  Data Modeling 
After cleaning, we structured the data using a star schema model. 
This involved separating the dataset into several dimension tables, 
such as Date, Product, Customer, and Region, with a central Fact 
table for sales transactions. 
The Date dimension was generated and managed using Power 
Query 
Finally, the entire data model was loaded into Power BI, where we 
built interactive visualizations and dashboards to support insightful 
and data-driven reporting. 
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
A comprehensive exploratory analysis was conducted using PowerBI, 
supported by over 20 custom DAX measures. The aim was to 
identify trends, patterns, and anomalies across various aspects of the 
Superstore dataset.  
The analysis was structured across the following key areas: 
1.Time-Based Analysis 
Sales and profit trends were examined across years 
(2015‚Äì2018), months, and quarters 

2.Product Performance 
Product categories and subcategories were analyzed based on 
sales volume, sales contribution, and discount impact 

3.Customer Behavior 
Customers were segmented by type (consumer, business, home 
office) to assess purchase frequency, average order value, and 
overall contribution. Metrics such as number of customers 

4.Regional Insights 
Sales were analyzed geographically at the region and state 
level. 
bar charts were used to highlight areas of high performance and 
underperformance. 
A breakdown of shipping methods and their impact by region 
was also explored. 

5.Shipping Impact 
Additional analysis focused on the effect of different shipping 
modes on sales performance and delivery efficiency.  
The impact of shipping types across regions and customer 
segments was explored to better understand operational 
performance.

including importing the Excel file, cleaning the data, removing duplicates, and 
standardizing fields such as Product IDs. 
Power Query : Applied for data transformation, generating Date dimension 
tables, filtering rows, and shaping the data for analysis within Power BI. 
Power BI Desktop : Used for data modeling, building relationships using a star 
schema (Fact and Dimension tables), and creating interactive visualizations and 
dashboards. 
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) : Used to create calculated columns and 
measures for key metrics such as Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM), 
Retention Rate, and Average Order Value.
